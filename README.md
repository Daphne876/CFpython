# Instacart_python

# Context
Instacart is an app used for online grocery shopping. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I will perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

# Objective
The Instacart stakeholders are interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
